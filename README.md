### The only way you'll be able to view reports on the prl dashboard is by filling up a report from the lecturer dashboard then going back to the login page and login with the credentials of prl, for some reason even though the database is updated, upon starting the react app the prl dashboard says no reports filled but then after you fill a report from the lecturer dashboard then, only then will you see the reports.

### Although some features are not operational, i'll try my very best and keep incremetally improving this project to the best of my abilities
