1.Accessing the Lecturer Dashboard:
email - Manthabiseng@gmail password - "mathematicsisgood"

2.Accessing the Student Dashboard:

3.Accessing the PRL Dashboard:

4.Accessing the PL Dashboard:

The only way you'll be able to view reports on the prl dashboard is by filling up a report from the lecturer dashboard then going back to the login page and login with the credentials of prl, for some reason even though the database is updated, upon starting the react app the prl dashboard says no reports filled but then after you fill a report from the lecturer dashboard then, only then will you see the reports.
